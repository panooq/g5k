# g5k
an internet search engine

Introduction and Description

This repository represents a project that I have been working on for several years.  It is a search engine that is designed to produce a list of websites with information related to the search term.  It is extremely limited and probably much easier to do with some kind of advanced google search.  

The project is titled g5k, simply because that is the name of my web page (g5k.co).  g5k is a series of perl scripts (at this point) that reside on my home computer and perform the following actions:

* Download the front page from a series of web addresses
* Scrape the pages for links
* Search the pages for references to search terms

It seems simple enough, but within the limitations of the perl language, it has proven a little challenging for my humble skills.  

The idea is that the internet is vast, but it's not actually so immense that it's impossible to search.  Massive search engines provide millions of search results, but most of them are not useful.  As an information searcher, you are really looking for sources of information that are related to your topic.  Eventually, this search engine will provide links to sources where you may wish to look for additional information.  Rather then attempting to search all the information in all the web pages, it only looks for specific pages that you may want to search yourself.  For instance, this search engine may help you to locate a publically available database that contains information related to some specific topic.

It's a simple idea, but it's been an educational experience building and testing this project thus far.  I've learned a lot about the internet.  I hope that by using this repository, this project may grow and evolve a little more rapidly and with the broadened experience pool of the programming community.
